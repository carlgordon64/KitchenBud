# KitchenBud
Repo for Raspberry Pi Kitchen Media Hub Code

Notes:
The Goal of this project is to create a dynamic homescreen for the Kitchen Bud that allows me to easily set up quick links to my favourite wesbites / web apps.
It's still currently a sandbox to see what is possible with html + css.

This version was built before any hardware tests have been completed so viewport sizing may be slightly off.

This code uses Flickity Carousel (https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) for the smooth page transitioning.

Patch Notes:
SQL Queries tidied up to not worry about the number of rows in a table.
Issue fixed with Search Bar changing back to Google when not being changed on page update.
Button added for TED.com so I can learn cool shit while in the kitchen.

TO DO:
Remove Priority from Pages as their order is fixed anyway.
Update Edit_page_2.php
