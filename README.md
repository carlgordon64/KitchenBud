# KitchenBud
Repo for Raspberry Pi Kitchen Media Hub Code

Notes:
The Goal of this project is to create a dynamic homescreen for the Kitchen Bud that allows me to easily set up quick links to my favourite wesbites / web apps.
It's still currently a sandbox to see what is possible with html + css.

This version was built before any hardware tests have been completed so viewport sizing may be slightly off.

This code uses Flickity Carousel (https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) for the smooth page transitioning.
